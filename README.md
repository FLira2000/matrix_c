# matrix_c

Hi everyone! This project originaly was a test, but right now is more a project of my own than just it.

This library permits to the programmer using it to handle matrices in mathematical level, and its functions can serve some Linear Algebra basic operations like multiplications and other more specific like extracting the inferior triangle from a matrix.

This repo is currently paused, but the project is WIP.
Any contributions are welcome!
